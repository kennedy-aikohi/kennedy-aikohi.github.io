Vulnerability Assessment Analyst**

I am a **cybersecurity analyst** with hands-on experience across
**security operations**, **malware research**, **detection
engineering**, and **incident response**. My work focuses on
understanding **adversary tradecraft**, improving **detection
coverage**, and translating complex technical findings into **clear,
actionable intelligence** for security teams.

I have practical experience working within **SOC environments**,
monitoring enterprise systems using **SIEM** and **EDR platforms**,
triaging **security alerts**, and tuning detections to reduce **false
positives** while maintaining **high-fidelity coverage**. My approach
emphasizes **visibility**, **accuracy**, and alignment with **real-world
attacker behavior**.

I conduct hands-on **malware analysis** and **reverse engineering**,
including **static analysis**, **dynamic analysis**, **runtime behavior
inspection**, and investigation of **native Windows execution
techniques**. My research spans **multiple malware families**,
**scripting abuse**, **persistence mechanisms**, and **encryption
workflows**, with a strong focus on **defensive detection
opportunities** and **mitigation strategies**.

I actively maintain and expand my skills through **labs**,
**simulations**, **CTF-style challenges**, and **independent research**.
My work is documented through **technical reports** and **projects**
that demonstrate **applied understanding** rather than theoretical
knowledge, with emphasis on **repeatable methodology** and **operational
relevance**.

**Areas of Focus**

- **Security Operations Center (SOC) Analysis**
- **Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering**
- **Detection Engineering** (YARA, Sigma, SIEM, EDR)
- **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)**
- **Threat Hunting & MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**
- **Windows Internals & Native Execution Abuse**
